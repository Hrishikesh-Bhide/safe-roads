## Inspiration
When planning a car journey, we often prioritize factors like travel time, traffic, and toll costs, but one critical aspect that tends to be overlooked is road safety. While most navigation apps excel at providing directions and real-time traffic updates, few emphasize the importance of ensuring your safety during the journey.

This is where our application, Safe-Road, steps in to bridge this gap. We offer a distinctive and invaluable feature that places accident prevention at the forefront of your travel experience. Unlike other apps that primarily come into play after an accident has already occurred, Safe-Road is dedicated to proactively preventing accidents from happening in the first place.

Our app provides you with the option to select routes that not only optimize travel efficiency but also prioritize safety. We take your well-being seriously and guide you toward routes with fewer reported accidents. Safe-Road empowers you to make informed decisions and take precautionary steps to avoid accident-prone roads, ensuring your safety is paramount.

With Safe-Road, you can embark on your journey with the confidence that you are actively enhancing your safety on the road.
